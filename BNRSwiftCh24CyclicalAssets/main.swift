// this creates two strong reference cycles.  bob has a reference to the laptop and the laptop has a reference to bob (via it's owner property).  Same for bob and the hat.  the memory for these instances is no longer reachable--al variables pointing to them gone, but memory will never be reclaimed because each instance has a reference count greater than 0
// break this cycle by adding "weak" in front of var owner: Person
// weak reference doesn't increase the reference count of the instance it refers to
// weak references must always be declared as var, not let
// weak references must always be declared as optional
// since Person is a class that owns assets, it makes sense to keep strong references to tha ssets.  Asset is a class owned by the person, so if it wants a reference to the owner, tthat reference should be weak.
